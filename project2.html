<h2>Future Plans</h2>
	<p> My future plans are very up in the air at this point, which is a fancy way of saying <b>I have no idea what I want to do with my life </b>. As a senior, I will be graduating next year, which is actually <em>really</em> sad. As of now, I am looking for a job and will probably spend most of the year applying for different jobs and hopefully interviewing. I do not have a preference for what I do, but I would like to find something that I can enjoy. I definitely want to live in a bigger city like Chicago or New York but I would be willing to live other places as well.</p>
